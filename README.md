* Instructions Design and Implement a Java program as follows: 

* 1) Create CoveredInbox class as follows 
*           Attributes to keep track when inbox is opened/closed and how many letters it has 
*           Functionality: 
*            o Get number of letters - fails if inbox is still closed 
*            o Open inbox - fails if already opened 
*            o Close inbox - fails if already closed 
*            o Add letter to inbox (increments number of letters) - fails if inbox is closed 
*            o Remove letter from inbox (decrements number of letters) -
*              fails if inbox is closed 
* 2) Create RunInbox class with main method which stores the instance of inbox 
* 3) In main method display a menu where the user can: 
*            1: Open inbox 
*            2: Close inbox

* and appropriate set methods
